            <h3>Step 2: Select Zoom as your location </h3>

            <h3>How to Remove your Zoom App.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Visit your <a href="/account" target="_blank"> Integrations page </a> and select Zoom.</li>
                <li>Click on Disconnect Zoom</li>
                <li>Your Zoom App will be removed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note: By Disconnecting your Zoom from Incio means you will no longer be able to create Events with Zoom as the primary option which means you wonâ€™t be able to create any automatic meetings/invites for your self/invitees.</p>
